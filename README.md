# dczaj_SNP
This Repo is supposed to help out with some -somewhat unscientific - DNA Analysis

####

The file snp_to_summary.csv contains a list of -"randomly"- selected conditions and illnesses that according to https://www.snpedia.com/ result from the respectivly listed Single-nucleotide polymorphism. All information was manually taken from https://www.snpedia.com/. I can neither guarantee that I didn't make an error copying the Data nor that https://www.snpedia.com/ has perfectly accurate information.

If you worry about your health please consult with a medical professional.

From personal experience I can confirm that rs4988235 has been medically confirmed with me when I was a child but that is just one SNP so take it with a grain of salt.
